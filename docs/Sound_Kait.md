# Sound: Kait

The sound moves between long, legato notes (sun intensity = 0) towards very short, staccato notes (sun intensity = 1). The short notes during periods of high sun intensity were designed to accommodate the sounds dialogue with the [parrots](Sound_Parrots.md): When parrot activity is also highest, each parrot call triggers a note in this sound generator. When sun intensity is <0.8, this sound is triggered by the [music system's clock](Sound_Overview.md).

The sound was inspired by this song by Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith, hence the name.
