Parrots use two sets of sounds, one with more quiet calls, and another with louder calls.
The sound has four voices, each voice can produce a cluster of calls. Each of the four voices is routed to a different audio source in the scene. The audio sources are arranged in a circle around a central point, at different heights. A script lets the points circle around the central axis so that the movement of the audio sources roughly corresponds with the circling movement of the parrots.
