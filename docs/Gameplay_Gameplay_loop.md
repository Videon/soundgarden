The main gameplay loop consists of the player moving around the island in first-person view, searching and collecting [stones](Gameplay_Collectables.md). Whenever the player collects a stone, another stone will spawn in a different location. As of now, possible stone spawn areas are predetermined. Whenever a stone is spawned, it will spawn only in areas at a certain distance away from the player. This is to ensure that the player will always need to roam around before finding the next stone.
