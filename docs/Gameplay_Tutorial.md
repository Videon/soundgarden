At the start of the game, the player passes through a tutorial, aimed at familiarizing them with the gameplay mechanics and the layout of the island. In this phase, [stones](Gameplay_Collectables.md) will spawn in the playerâ€™s view. Early in the tutorial, the player will pass by an illustration that depicts the game mechanic.

Some stones are placed near barriers that unlock access to other areas of the island. These barriers disappear visibly in front of the player when they collect a nearby stone. This is meant to teach players that collecting stones leads to some outcome. Collectable stones emanate a faint light that can be seen in dark environments. At the start of the tutorial, it is dark on the island. Throughout the tutorial, the sun will rise gradually after collecting stones at certain locations. This is to further facilitate player guidance, by using the sunlight to emphasize newly accessible areas. By the time the player has collected all stones in the tutorial, all areas of the island have been unlocked and the [main game phase begins](Gameplay_Gameplay_loop.md).
