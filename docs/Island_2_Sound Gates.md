# Sound Gates


The sound gates feature gameplay in which the player must recognize one differing sound out of three by listening closely to each sound. Choosing the odd sound and stepping through the correct gate will allow the player to move on to the next row of gates, while choosing the wrong gate will close the current row of gates and block further traversal. To reset the gates, the player must return to the start. The order of correct gates is randomized on each run.

The example video above features two types of sounds: triangle wave and saw wave. Two out of three gates feature the triangle wave. The third gate holds the odd sound, here a sine wave. In the video, the player correctly traverses the first two rows, before choosing the wrong gate in the third row, prompting them to return to the start and begin anew.
