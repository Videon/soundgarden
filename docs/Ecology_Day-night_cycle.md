The day-night cycle has a significant impact on the island's ecology since it controls the movement of the sun, which in turn affects sun intensity. Sun intensity is observed by several entities in the environment: Parrots are only active when there is daylight, whereas the audible crickets or visible fireflies in the swamp are only active at very low levels of sun intensity.

One day in Soundgarden lasts 24 minutes, i.e., one real-world minute corresponds to one game-world hour.
