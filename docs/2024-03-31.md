A momentary snapshot. 9:37 PM. Sunday.
Despite various attempts at relaxing, this project is difficult to let go.

I was disappointed that Acoustics didn't solve all audio immersion problems, or any at all, for that matter. I'm sure with more time and learning I could achieve better results. For now, however, let's go take a quick and dirty, non systemic approach: using snapshots of real-world reverbs (impulse responses) to achieve a sense of space by affecting the ways that sound travels - or rather appears to travel - on our simulated island.

But now I think, why am I striving for realism? There must be certain aspects of it that may enhance our experience. However, now I think the impact it creates as an experience is more pertinent. Through that, realism may still be approached but from a different angle.
For now, I've placed impulse responses for the main areas: swamp, beach, cave, hill. As soon as I'll find fitting impulse responses, I will add them to the remaining areas as well.

Debugging as an afterthought? But then again, there aren't that many bugs because I'm only working on one thing at a time...

The implementation of the parrots is not always great. I noticed that the calls sounded artificial when few.
