This is the last journal entry that is taking place during the initial development phase of this project, which is part of my self-directed research. I will outline some of the last changes and additions of the previous weeks and then move on to conduct a little retrospective of what happened here in the past three months.







**Post mortem?**
I don't understand why these project retrospectives are referred to as post mortems. At least in my case, the project is far from dead - if anything it has become alive only now that all the relevant systems are in place:
- Adaptive procedural music system
- Custom attenuation settings for different sound sources
- Local reverb, with different settings per area
- Gameplay: Collecting stones
- Rewards: Events happening when the player collect certain numbers of stones
- Day/night system
- Footstep system
- Audible actors with dynamic parameters


Unfortunately, I lost a few days trying to fix the project, which began with all the light settings being broken. Trying to fix the issue, I upgraded to the Unreal 5.4 preview version. However, since that didn't fix the problem and introduced several new ones, I had to downgrade back to 5.3. This was far from trivial, since Unreal projects are generally not meant to be downgraded - I couldn't open the map anymore after going back. Copying parts of previous commits into the current one helped getting everything running again but at the same time, it lead to an unknown error when trying to make a built. After a few days of experimenting, upgrading and downgrading again, everything was finally back to normal. I'm not sure what specifically fixed the issue but I'm sure glad it's over. I'm less glad, however, that this happened just when all parts of the project had come into place. I had hoped that at this point, it would be quick and easy to add various enhancements - a new ambient sound here, another reward for collecting stones there, maybe some more reverb etc.

In general, I was fighting technical issues far more often than anticipated. It began with various issues back when the project still ran in Unity (see [2024-02-14](2024-02-14.md)). Then, after switching to Unreal, I would often need to stop and learn a new skill that would allow me to do the things I wanted/needed to do. While I can safely say that I am now much more confident in using Unreal than I was three months ago, I'm also under the impression that these intermittent bouts of forced learning were in the way of developing more creative and experimental approaches for Soundgarden.
