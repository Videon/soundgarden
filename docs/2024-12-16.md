Recap of this phase so far
- Developed two (three?) sound-led mechanics
- Added island 2

General additions
- Saved games and issues implementing them
- Having to track relevant game state data like time of day and collected stones
- Main menu and settings incl graphics

Island 1 improvements
- Fixed sound sources, making for a soundscape as lush as intended
- 

I am yet to finish phase 2. The second island still offers enough space to host two or three more sound-led interactions.
