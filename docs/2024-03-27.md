**Connecting reality and simulation by applying observed patterns**

The figure below depicts the audible activity of three different animal groups over a 24-hour period. The curves which are derived from observed animal activity resemble curves that game engines use to set continuous values.

Working with game engines involves an inversion of the process that yields data from observations. Here, by setting the data either directly (e.g., drawing an animation curve that changes values over time), or modifying procedural actors, which leads to an emergence of data (e.g., imagine having procedurally generated flocks of birds that are programmed to be active at certain times of day) has a significant influence on the resulting data.

- Add day/night cycle using these curves


**On Normalization**

Whenever a logical component, for example a module in my music system, uses float parameters for input or output, I map them to a range between 0 and 1, also referred to as a unit interval in mathematics. Not only allows this for easier connection of different components because values don't need to be remapped, it allows for "logical compression", i.e., deriving meaning from a value and its name. 0 will always be the least of something, or off, whereas 1 will always be the maximum, the most intense. See the section on parrots above for another example.

If all parts of the music system, as well as game logic, use normalized values as in/outputs, connecting the individual components becomes trivial.

There is also a simple implementation of music intensity that goes up the further the player is away from the next stone. Should play around with distances more here. Currently, intensity (0...1) is connected to some rhythmic elements, leading to more intense percussion patterns (=more hits) with values towards intensity = 1 when the player is far away from the goal, and no percussion at all (intensity = 0) when the player is close to the goal. The idea is to animate the player to move around and look for the stone using more animated percussive patterns.

I reduced the island size. While the feeling of wandering can be a mode of experience, it felt too tiresome to walk all the way around the island looking for a collectible. 


**Situating the island sounds**

I created sound objects that would be symbols for certain areas on the map.

Keynotes
- Waves clashing in the background, washing over the shore

Signals
- Birds flying by ???

Soundmarks
- Cove: Musical frogs
- Hill: Musical wind
- Beach: Musical waves

Soundmarks are the unique sounds that define a location. Since the island environment is not based on a real place, one might argue that there cannot be any soundmarks here.
However, what defines this island are its musical sounds, which are unique to this virtual locus. I will therefore interpret these as soundmarks.


- Keep in mind new environmental sounds need custom attenuation curves
