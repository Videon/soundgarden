Ambience activity is a sound source that simulates a dynamic activity based on observed value. Activity is mediated via an activity curve that transforms the observed value into the level of sound activity. For example, the cricket sound in the swamp is such an ambience activity, tied to the sun intensity. It gradually fades in as sun intensity moves toward 0, and fades out when it goes back up.
