# Gameplay: Game controller


The game controller is responsible for tracking the collection of collectables. During the tutorial phase, it unlocks the barriers on the island when the respective collectible was collected. After the tutorial ends, the game controller will count all subsequent collectibles and [trigger events](Gameplay_Collectable_events.md) that are tied to collecting certain amounts of collectibles.
