# Sound: Reverb

[The different areas on the island](Gameplay_Map.md) have distinctive sound characteristics which are approximated using impulse responses of real-world locations that resemble the geometrical and surfaces features of the associated location on the Soundgarden island. If the player moves within one of the reverb volumes that are placed on the island, the respective effect will be activated. *As of now, reverb is not yet implemented.
