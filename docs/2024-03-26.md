Thu night. Sitting and ideating. 11:20 pm
I was looking for interesting rhythmical patterns to implement for different levels of musical intensities, or activities.

Patterns on the cave wall that represent the rhythm generated by the music patch.


Still learning Unreal. Sometimes losing days to learn and then implement what I need. This slows me down.


I had trouble programming a rhythm that was otherwise easy to play for me when tapping my fingers on my desk. I wanted to visualize it and opened procreate to draw a pattern of points meant to represent the two rhythmic elements. The brush made me think of the painting on the wall. I wanted to have a cave drawing of the rhythm which the player could watch


Added MS Acoustics but after three days of rendering, the result was not good enough.
I can't afford such long iteration cycles. I will therefore look for another approach to have a believable reverberation and occlusion. Unreal supports impulse responses for its reverb. I can look for impulse responses of spaces with a similar geometry and surface structure, to approximate how the environment would affect and shape the sounds.
