Activity curves are used to transform observed values into levels of activity. Multiple entities may observe the same value but may interpret it differently: For example, both the activity of parrots and crickets depend on the sun intensity. However, where parrots are active during high levels of sun intensity, crickets are only active during low levels. 


Swamp activity curve (crickets)

Swamp activity only takes place when sun intensity is between 0 and 0.4, gradually fading/in out between these value.


Parrot activity curve

Note how parrot activity only begins at sun intensity values > 0.3 and peaks at sun intensity = 1.
