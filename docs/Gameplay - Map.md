The main areas consist of a swamp, beach, and hillside outlook, as well as a cave, and an elevated path around the swamp on the edge of the island.

**Swamp**

The swamp is mainly populated by frogs and fireflies and is mostly active at night.


**Hill**

The hill is populated by parrots. From its outlook position, the player can overlook most of the island, with the possibility to spot collectable rocks from there. If the player does not see any rocks from the outlook position, they may deduce that the next collectible is in the cave area, which is the only location that is not visible from that position.

**Beach**

The beach

**Ocean path**

Walking on the ocean path allows the player to hear the combined soundscapes of the hill, swamp and ocean, depending on their position along the path. The player can see parts of the swamp from there, allowing them to spot collectables in that area.

**Cave**

The map is designed such that the player can move through it without running into any dead ends. The only area where this is not the case is the outlook on top of the hill.
