A tree.

Trees observe the global wind intensity, which affects their shader that controls swaying movement. Higher wind intensity leads to stronger swaying, lower wind intensity to weaker swaying. Audio sources for the playback of leaf rustling sounds are placed among the tree crowns. The occurrence, length and volume of the sounds is also modulated by the wind intensity parameter.
