# Rhythm Grid


The rhythm grid presents a series of platforms that players must traverse in sync with the given rhythm. Red platforms can be stepped on, while yellow transparent platforms indicate the previous and following platforms, supporting the player in anticipating the movement of the path. An accompanying percussive loop underlines the given rhythm, intended to support the player in moving with the beat.

The example video above features two rhythmic patterns, indicated by a higher note that plays two hits per loop, and a lower note, playing three hits per loop. In the first two sections, the grids are triggered by the 2-hit note. The third section incorporates both two-hit and three-hit rhythms, resulting in the traversable platforms of each grid meeting at different points in time, which requires the player to pay close attention to the timing and anticipate this moment.
