**Wind gameplay improvements**
- Before: fixed rig, rectangle moving along spline with sound emitters at each corner
- Now: Dynamic placement of front/rear wind sources around player along spline
- In theory, if the player keeps following one of the two pairs of sound sources, they should end up at either end of the tunnel
- Interesting: When either pair of sound sources is on either side of the player, the sources sound "mono". When player faces one sound, for example, looking towards one direction so that the sources are ahead, the sound sources sound "stereo". This could help in learning how to follow the sound.
- While during my own testing this setup seems to be effective in leading me through the tunnel, only feedback from other players will tell if more improvements will be necessary. Will report back on this.
