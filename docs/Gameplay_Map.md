The island's main areas consist of a swamp in its center, a beach in the east, hillside outlook (eye symbol), a cave in the south, and an elevated path around the swamp on the edge of the island.

**Swamp**

The swamp is mainly populated by [frogs](Sound_Frogs.md) and fireflies and is mostly active at night.


**Hill**

The hill is populated by [parrots](Sound_Parrots.md). From its outlook position, the player can overlook most of the island, with the possibility to spot collectable rocks from there. If the player does not see any rocks from the outlook position, they may deduce that the next collectible is in the cave area, which is the only location that is not visible from that position. The map is designed such that the player can move through it without running into any dead ends. The only area where this is not the case is the outlook on top of the hill. This is intended to slow the player down and have them pay attention to their surroundings.


**Beach**

The beach is the only area that directly connects to the ocean. Here, the player can listen to the sounds of the musical waves and [manipulate the speed](Gameplay_Collectable_events.md) of [the day-night cycle](Ecology_Day-night_cycle.md).

**Ocean path**

Walking on the ocean path allows the player to hear the combined soundscapes of the hill, swamp and ocean, depending on their position along the path. The player can see parts of the swamp from there, allowing them to spot [collectables](Gameplay_Collectables.md) in that area. 

**Cave**

The cave is mainly a transitional area that allows the player to move from the beach to the north of the island without passing through the swamp. It was intended as a space that offers a [reverberating](Sound_Reverb.md) contrast to the open spaces in the rest of the island.
