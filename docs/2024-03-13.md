- Added an invisible tutorial
- Gameplay: Added illustration "pick up stone" to the wall

This entry will focus on the conceptual sound side of things. But before I get to that, I want to get a few gameplay-related things out of the way.

**Gameplay**


**Soundwalking**

I conducted a soundwalk on the island. Not listen to what's there, but rather to what isn't.
I was looking at the leaves that weren't rustling,
I was listening to the wind that wasn't howling,
Saw a swamp as still and lifeless as ever.

I was a ghost that walked weightlessly upon the sand,
the rocks, the mud, the dirt.

There's an endless ocean all around - but no sound.

This little exercise in sound mindfulness has helped me to come up with a to do list of sounds to fill the sonic void.


**Player embodiment**

I was thinking about player embodiment: How to evoke a sense of player presence? How to make the player feel as if they are on the island? There is an inherent act of player embodiment in the that stems from the interactive nature of a game: moving around the game world, influencing its objects can be seen as acts of embodiment. It is be enhancing and expanding these interactions that we as game designers facilitate embodiment in the worlds we create.

One common way would be the addition of player character sounds. I should add footsteps, and possibly other sounds that would stem from player interaction. I'm also thinking about adding microphone support: The player can make sounds which are then shaped by the game environment. This would require a convincing implementation of spatial audio. Microsoft Acoustics would be a solution for that. Going to look into that soon.

**Connecting reality and simulation by applying observed patterns**

The figure below depicts the audible activity of three different animal groups over a 24-hour period. The curves which are derived from observed animal activity resemble curves that game engines use to set continuous values.

Working with game engines involves an inversion of the process that yields data from observations. Here, by setting the data either directly (e.g., drawing an animation curve that changes values over time), or modifying procedural actors, which leads to an emergence of data (e.g., imagine having procedurally generated flocks of birds that are programmed to be active at certain times of day) has a significant influence on the resulting data.

**On combining sound symbols and acousmatics**



I created sound objects that would be symbols for certain areas on the map.

Keynotes
- Waves clashing in the background, washing over the shore

Signals
- Birds flying by ???

Soundmarks
- Cove: Musical frogs
- Hill: Musical wind
- Beach: Musical waves

Soundmarks are the unique sounds that define a location. Since the island environment is not based on a real place, one might argue that there cannot be any soundmarks here.
However, what defines this island are its musical sounds, which are unique to this virtual locus. I will therefore interpret these as soundmarks.


Frogs üê∏üê∏üê∏
I replaced the previous bubbly swamp sound with frog calls. Here, the combination of the natural and non-natural lies in the processing of a natural sound. Since the frog sounds have a discernable musical pitch, I changed the pitch of every frog call sample to roughly correspond with a C note. This allowed for pitching the frog sounds dynamically along the given musical scale. I wanted the frogs to croaking in harmony with the music, however, the pitch of the sound is not clear enough for the harmony to be audible, so I will either add another layer with a clearer discernible pitch, or use different frog sounds.


**Procedural parrots**
- Chopped samples
- Listened to original sample
- Compared occurrences of sounds. Clustered vs. individual
- For example, when few bird sounds would be heard in succession, the distance between individual calls was greater, and vice versa
- 


...However, certain technical optimizations, such as creating individual patches for every function make real-time manipulation of parameters far less immediate than using a real modular synthesizer. Nevertheless, there is still enough level of immediacy to allow for moments of listening to the subtleties of the sounds and finely tweaking parameters to find the most interesting and fitting ones.

**Reworked the cove sound**

Reworked the cove sound. I think I found a nice musical adaptation of bubbles randomly bursting in a body of water. This would fit better in a swamp but I will look into either adapting the sound to the new setting, or adding some visuals that would create a connection to the sound. Instead of having the "bubbles" burst at random moments, they are triggered in intervals that are relative to the length of a chosen measure in the overall music. The small differences in intervals accumulate, leading to an ever-repeating moving rhythmic cycle.


**On Normalization**

0...1

If all parts of the music system, as well as game logic, use normalized values as in/outputs, connecting the individual components becomes trivial.

**On MDM and the granularity of documentation**

How much should I go into detail? There is a reasoning behind every stone that is set. Sometimes the reasoning is unclear, it stems from an intuitive artistic process, "decorating the landscape". However, with time, the result of this process is refined, and reasoning crystallizes. Take this rock wall, for example.

This is my first project working with MDM. I normally extensively rely on using Trello with an agile approach when it comes to working on projects. However, 

...

Instead of living task to task off of my board, I find myself thinking about the project a lot.



I reduced the island size. While the feeling of wandering can be a mode of experience, it felt too tiresome to walk all the way around the island looking for a collectible. 

**More thoughts on MDM**
I certainly enjoy the newfound freedom that MDM has brought me. I feel like I know what it means to do design again and to make games again, and I love trying out ideas in this context. There is one minor thing I noticed that may be due to MDM. I implemented some code for spawning the collectibles which I think I would have implemented in a more efficient manner had I used the Trello board. I do think the board helps in thinking in terms of more traditional software design terms, which can be handy to know sometimes. In my case, this knowledge helped to implement gameplay ideas in more technically efficient and effective ways. I realized it was much better to use a data structure called Area where the area holds a Boolean value that indicates whether the area has been unlocked and the area holds all the spawn points for collectibles. This makes logical sense and is easier to work with, however, having this realization alone means that it is certainly possible to think about good technical implementation whenever it becomes necessary
This is essentially an inversion of my Trello workflow where I would stop and think about design whenever something technical would not be working, whereas now I think about the technical whenever it is in the way of design/gameplay. This makes for a much more creative workflow and more interesting outcomes. MDM rules!


Over the next days/weeks, I want to experiment with post lengths, aiming for shorter but far more frequent posts.

I also noticed that I I have been doing far fewer commits. Now, I commit once an idea is complete, rather than at every step of incidentally developing it. This has lead to commit intervals of up to one week. I don't think that this is good practice. Overnight data loss is real. I should do commits all the time, and I need to find another way managing the completion of ideas that feels a bit more meaningful than ticking a box off a list, which I already do with handwritten digital to do lists.
