**Soundwalking**

I conducted a soundwalk on the island. Not listen to what's there, but rather to what isn't.
I was looking at the leaves that weren't rustling. I was listening to the wind that wasn't howling. Saw a swamp as still and lifeless as ever. I was a ghost that walked weightlessly upon the sand, the rocks, the mud, the dirt. There's an endless ocean all around - but no sound.



**On combining sound symbols and acousmatics**


I created sound objects that would be symbols for certain areas on the map.

Keynotes
- Waves clashing in the background, washing over the shore

Signals
- Birds flying by ???

Soundmarks
- Cove: Musical frogs
- Hill: Musical wind
- Beach: Musical waves

Soundmarks are the unique sounds that define a location. Since the island environment is not based on a real place, one might argue that there cannot be any soundmarks here.
However, what defines this island are its musical sounds, which are unique to this virtual locus. I will therefore interpret these as soundmarks.


Frogs
I replaced the previous bubbly swamp sound with frog calls. Here, the combination of the natural and non-natural lies in the processing of a natural sound. Since the frog sounds have a discernable musical pitch, I changed the pitch of every frog call sample to roughly correspond with a C note. This allowed for pitching the frog sounds dynamically along the given musical scale - the frogs are croaking in harmony with the music! üê∏üê∏üê∏


**Procedural parrots**
- Chopped samples
- Listened to original sample
- Compared occurrences of sounds. Clustered vs. individual
- For example, when few bird sounds would be heard in succession, the distance between individual calls was greater, and vice versa
- 


...However, certain technical optimizations, such as creating individual patches for every function make real-time manipulation of parameters far less immediate than using a real modular synthesizer. Nevertheless, there is still enough level of immediacy to allow for moments of listening to the subtleties of the sounds and finely tweaking parameters to find the most interesting and fitting ones.

**Reworked the cove sound**

Reworked the cove sound. I think I found a nice musical adaptation of bubbles randomly bursting in a body of water. This would fit better in a swamp but I will look into either adapting the sound to the new setting, or adding some visuals that would create a connection to the sound. Instead of having the "bubbles" burst at random moments, they are triggered in intervals that are relative to the length of a chosen measure in the overall music. The small differences in intervals accumulate, leading to an ever-repeating moving rhythmic cycle.


**On Normalization**

0...1

If all parts of the music system, as well as game logic, use normalized values as in/outputs, connecting the individual components becomes trivial.

**On MDM and the granularity of documentation**

How much should I go into detail? There is a reasoning behind every stone that is set. Sometimes the reasoning is unclear, it stems from an intuitive artistic process, "decorating the landscape". However, with time, the result of this process is refined, and reasoning crystallizes. Take this rock wall, for example.

This is my first project working with MDM. I normally extensively rely on using Trello with an agile approach when it comes to working on projects. However, 

...

Instead of living task to task off of my board, I find myself thinking about the project a lot.



I reduced the island size. While the feeling of wandering can be a mode of experience, it felt too tiresome to walk all the way around the island looking for a collectible.
