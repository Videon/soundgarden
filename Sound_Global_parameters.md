**Intensity**
General musical intensity. Values closer to 1 are meant to control other instruments such that they produce a more intense outcome, which may be characterized by more notes, louder dynamics, and more staccato articulation. Values closer to 0 would in turn mean fewer notes, more quiet dynamics, and more legato articulation.

**Sun intensity**
The strength of the sunlight at a given time. Mainly used to affect animal sounds, such as the [parrots](docs/Sound_Parrots.md).

**Wind intensity**
The strength of the wind at a given time. Currently used to affect the [wind ambience](docs/Sound_Wind.md) and rustling trees.
