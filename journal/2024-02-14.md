**Mapping things out**
The idea was to use height differences to maximize the distance between areas while keeping the footprint small. Further, I hope to create a sense of scale and make the map appear larger than it actually is.

I spent a lot of time looking at this configuration interface for the music system:

Above snapshot shows the configuration at the time I created this entry. Below is how it looked like when I uploaded this entry.

**Climbing notes**
I renamed the Arpeggiator. The generation of rhythm and melody is currently separate from each other. All the (now aptly named) climber does is selecting the note pitches by climbing a musical scale up or down, whereas an arpeggiator is typically also responsible for the repetition of the notes themselves, which is currently completely handled by setting the respective Euclidean rhythm parameters.
