**Soniferous Gardens**
"*A garden is a place where nature is cultivated. It is a humanized treatment of landscape. Trees, fruit, flowers, grass are sculpted organically from the wilderness by art and science. Sometimes the garden is drastically clipped and manicured, as in the harshly classical gardens of Versailles and Vienna; elsewhere man has restricted his touch to assisting certain characteristic features of the landscape to flourish. A true garden is a feast for all the senses.*" - R. Murray Schafer, The Soundscape, p. 246.

A soniferous garden is essentially an "acoustically designed park" (Schafer, p. 247)

A quick search on "soniferous garden video games" yielded only one relevant result, which is this video: [Soniferous Garden: Procedural Music Demo (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY9Jn-PLcxo)
While there is not much information on this project, it is interesting to see that someone else thought about combining the concept of the soniferous garden with procedural music.

Schafer explicitly mentions water and wind as elements that power water organs and wind harps. These can be seen as forms of generative music machines, powered by the elements. Therefore, the idea of incorporating generative music into a (virtual) soniferous garden makes absolute sense.
Since Schafer

I remember seeing a video that showed an irrigation system, possibly 

**Running into a (game) jam**
Originally I had planned to put together a simple proof of concept, developed over a weekend in game jam style. I wanted to: 
1. Upgrade my [[Procedural Music System]]
2. Build a game that uses the system for its core gameplay

This did not work out as planned. I simply put too much on my plate here, trying to do two things at the same time, and not making sure that all required tools are ready to use during the jam, the music system being one of those tools, and then, focusing on point 2 only.
Also, I realized it had been a while since I created a game from scratch. For the last two years I had been mostly involved in developing ongoing projects. I've become rusty.

**Mapping things out**
The idea was to use height differences to maximize the distance between areas while keeping the footprint small. Further, I hope to create a sense of scale and make the map appear larger than it actually is.


Musical Pac-Man?




I spent a lot of time looking at this configuration interface for the music system:

Above snapshot shows the configuration at the time I created this entry. Below is how it looked like when I uploaded this entry.

Next steps:
- Design distinctive sound settings for each area/music zone
- 


Further design considerations:
- Synchronize footstep sounds with the sequencer (does the player then become a part of the soniferous garden?)
- Place dynamic sound objects in the environments, possibly also synchronized with the music
-
